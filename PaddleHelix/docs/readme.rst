PaddleHelix is a machine-learning-based bio-computing framework aiming at facilitating the development of the following areas:
  * Vaccine design
  * Drug discovery
  * Precision medicine

Features
========

- High Efficency: We provide LinearRNA, a highly efficient toolkit for RNA structure prediction and analysis. LinearFold & LinearParitition achieves O(n) complexity in RNA-folding prediction, which is hundreds of times faster than traditional folding techniques.

- Large-scale Representation Learning and Transfer Learning: Self-supervised learning for molecule representations offers prospects of a breakthrough in tasks with limited annotation, including drug profiling, drug-target interaction, protein-protein interaction, RNA-RNA interaction, protein folding, RNA folding, and molecule design. PaddleHelix implements a variety of representation learning algorithms and state-of-the-art large-scale pre-trained models to help developers to start from "the shoulders of giants" quickly.
